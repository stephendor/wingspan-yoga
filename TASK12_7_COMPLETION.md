## Result
âœ… **Task 12.7 Successfully Completed**

The admin interface now includes a fully functional calendar view alongside the existing templates and instances views. Users can switch between different perspectives of the class data:
- **Templates**: Manage recurring class templates
- **Instances**: View upcoming class instances in list format  
- **Calendar**: Visualize classes in calendar format with color coding and multiple view options

The calendar view provides an intuitive way to visualize class schedules, instructor assignments, and class difficulty levels, making it easier for administrators to manage their yoga studio's class offerings.
