# Checking progress on Task 10 with Mux (2025-08-12 11:56Z)

_**User**_

I'd like you to use taskmaster-ai to determine the current progress of task 10. Much of it has been done, we are using Mux as a provider if that helps. I think we were on subtask 10.5 but check the repo for evidence of the other subtasks

_**Assistant**_

I’m going to check whether Taskmaster tasks exist, which tags are present, and retrieve the current task list; then I’ll scan the repo for Mux-related evidence to map progress on task 10 and its subtasks.

I’m going to open Taskmaster task files to get task 10 and its subtasks, and scan the repo for Mux-related code to verify which subtasks are implemented. I’m going to inspect key files to verify which subtask work exists: the Mux helper, the secure playback API, the video library page/UI, and the player integration; then I’ll confirm the Prisma schema includes the Video model. Checkpoint: I found Mux helpers with placeholder token logic, a protected playback-info API, Prisma’s Video model, and the video pages/components. Next I’ll open the video player and video pages plus the Taskmaster task files to confirm UI integration and recorded statuses. Here’s a concise, evidence-backed summary of the recent work and the current status of Task 10 (Secure Video Library with Mux), emphasizing the latest actions and outcomes.

## objectives and context
- Goal: Determine current progress of Task 10 using Taskmaster and repo evidence; verify Mux provider; assess which subtask is active.
- Assumption validated: Mux is the provider (dependency present and used).

## latest agent actions and results
- Opened Mux helper: `mux.ts`
  - Found initialized Mux client; helper stubs return basic HLS URL and base64 “token” placeholders (no real JWT signing yet).
- Reviewed secure playback API: `route.ts`
  - Auth required; membership gating implemented; constructs Mux HLS URL; issues placeholder token via `createPlaybackToken`.
- Inspected Prisma schema: `schema.prisma`
  - `Video` model has `streamingUrl` (Mux/Vimeo playback id), access flags, instructor relation.
- Verified video library UI and player integration:
  - Library: `page.tsx`, `VideoLibraryClient.tsx` (search/filters, access gating).
  - Player page: `page.tsx`, `VideoPlayerClient.tsx`.
  - Player component: `VideoPlayer.tsx` uses dynamic Plyr import with HLS source and token header; refreshes token on expiry.
- Confirmed Plyr presence: `plyr` dep, types in `plyr.d.ts`.

## mapping to task 10 subtasks
- Taskmaster (master tag) shows:
  - 10.1 Backend setup/modeling: pending
  - 10.2 Secure playback token/URL API: pending
  - 10.3 Video Library UI: done
  - 10.4 Responsive player integration: in-progress
  - 10.5 E2E/security verification: in-progress
- Repo evidence suggests:
  - 10.3 done: Library UI + filters implemented and gated.
  - 10.4 largely implemented: Player page + Plyr wired to secure endpoint; robust UX and progress tracking.
  - 10.2 functionally present but incomplete: Auth/membership checks exist; token is placeholder (no Mux signing keys/JWT). Should be “in-progress,” not “pending.”
  - 10.1 partly covered by existing `Video` model and instructor relations; no explicit asset ingestion/hosting ops wired end-to-end.
  - 10.5 in-progress: No test suite outputs found; token hardening still needed; direct Mux URL hardening relies on signed playback.

## immediate state and trigger
- Terminal session output retrieval failed earlier; switched to direct file reads and repo-wide searches.
- Preparing an authoritative progress report revealed a status mismatch for 10.2 versus code reality.

## next steps
- Finalize secure signing (blocks 10.2 and 10.5):
  - Add Mux signing key pair; implement real JWT signed playback (or signed playback IDs with Mux Playback Restrictions) in `mux.ts`; use in `playback-info` route.
  - Ensure the player sends token appropriately (header/cookie or signed URL param) and that unsigned direct stream access fails.
- Reconcile Taskmaster statuses:
  - Set 10.2 to in-progress (or done after signing is implemented).
  - Keep 10.4 in-progress until signed playback fully tested in-player.
  - Keep 10.5 in-progress; add E2E tests verifying:
    - Unauthorized users blocked
    - Members can fetch playback info
    - Direct access without token is denied
    - Token expiry refresh works
- Optional tightening:
  - Confirm `streamingUrl` stores Mux playback ID (private/signed policy).
  - Consider Mux Asset creation flows and admin tooling (if in-scope for 10.1).

## requirements coverage
- Identify Task 10 status/subtasks: Done (noted from `tasks.json` + mapped to evidence).
- Confirm Mux provider with code evidence: Done.
- Capture recent commands/outcomes: Done (file inspections and findings).
- Describe immediate pre-summarization state/trigger: Done.
- Provide next steps to finalize Task 10 progress reporting: Done.

If you want, I can update Taskmaster to reflect 10.2 as in-progress and add a subtask for implementing real Mux signed playback (JWT) before marking it done.

Do that and then implement the remaining subtasks

---

_**Assistant**_

I’m going to update the Taskmaster tasks to reflect reality: set 10.2 to in-progress and add a subtask for implementing real Mux signed playback (JWT). After coding and verification, I’ll mark 10.2 done and update parent status as appropriate. I’ll research Mux’s current signed playback token format and required JWT claims/headers to implement correct signing in our Node code, then use that to update our mux helper and API route. Batching quick reads to confirm current Mux helper code, API route, and dependencies before implementing signed playback and updating tasks. Implementing real Mux signed playback with JWTs: I'll update the Mux helper to sign tokens using signing keys, adjust the API route to append the token to the playback URL, remove header-based auth in the player, and add required env vars. 
```

```
Applying small edits to use Mux's Jwt signer, append the token to the playback URL in the API route, remove header-based auth in the player, and add signing env vars to .env.example. 
```

```
Patching API route, video player, and env example to wire JWT-signed tokens into the playback URL and remove header-based auth. 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Checkpoint: Implemented signed Mux playback tokens (jwt RS256) with env vars, appended token in playback URL, removed header auth in player. Now I'll fix minor TS/ESLint issues in VideoPlayer and run code quality checks for the edited files. 
```

```

```

```
Adding a minimal Jest test for the playback-info API to verify signed token in playback URL, then running code quality analysis on new and updated files. I'll quickly inspect the Jest config and auth/middleware path to ensure correct imports, then fix the test file to use ES module imports and proper typing so it passes lint.

```

```

```

```

```

```
I'm going to update the Task 10 subtasks' statuses to reflect the current repo reality and attach a brief implementation note, then add a developer doc for secure playback and E2E verification, and finally checkpoint what changed and what's next. 
```

```
I’m going to fix the markdown lint issues in the secure playback documentation by inserting the required blank lines and normalizing list formatting so it passes common markdown linters. 
```

```

```

```

```

```
I’m going to clean up the secure playback documentation to satisfy markdown lint rules, add a small helper script to generate signed Mux URLs for manual E2E checks, and wire a package script for it. 
```

```

````

````
I'll inspect `package.json` to confirm available scripts and avoid referencing non-existent commands, then I'll fix the markdown file to satisfy the linter by adjusting blank lines, list numbering, and indentation. 
```

```

```

```

```

```
I'm going to wire a configurable TTL for playback tokens, add a small helper script to generate signed URLs, update package.json, and refresh the docs to mention the new env/script; then I'll validate for type/lint errors and run the focused test.
