I'll help you with Taskmaster. Let me run the `task-master` command to see the current state of your tasks.

It looks like you have a good number of tasks in your project. The recommended next task is **#6 - Homepage and Static Pages Development**, which is already in progress.

What would you like to do?

*   **Continue with task #6?** I can show you the details for it.
*   **Work on another task?** Just let me know the ID.
*   **Something else?** I can help you add, remove, or update tasks.

Use taskmaster to help you and make a full code review of the repository with respect to each of the tasks and subtasks in taskmaster. I do not need you to make changes but provide me with a full report including security issues and vulnerabilities, improved code (repetition, redundancy, style, excellence), improved style for UI and UX elements, improvements to front and back end. Ask further questions if you would like more information
