_**Assistant**_

Task Master AI is now initialized in your project. To use Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, and Flash Lite:

1. Your `.env` file is set up with your Gemini API key.
2. The interactive setup and rule profiles for Gemini, Claude Code, and VS Code are installed.
3. You can run `npx task-master models --setup` to select Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`) as your main or research models.

If you want to change models later, rerun the setup command. Claude Code is available, but you need an Anthropic API key to use it.

You are ready to use Gemini and Copilot with Task Master AI. Let me know if you need help with specific commands or further configuration.
