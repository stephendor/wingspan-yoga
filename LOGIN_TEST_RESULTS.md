  "membershipType": "admin",
  "role": "admin",
  "membershipStatus": "ACTIVE"
}
```

#### 4. Route Access Testing ✅

5. **Session Management**: JWT tokens and sessions include role information
6. **Route Protection**: Middleware configured for role-based access
7. **Login Interface**: Sign-in page accessible and functional

#### 🎯 Ready for Production Use:
- Admin can log in with: `admin@wingspan-yoga.com` / `rufus@power0`
