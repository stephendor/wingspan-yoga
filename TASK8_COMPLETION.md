# Task 8 Completion – Class Booking & Stripe Payment Flow (ST-102)

Date: 2025-08-10

## Scope

End-to-end implementation of booking + payment workflow: PaymentIntent creation, transactional booking confirmation, idempotency & capacity safeguards, UI integration, email stub, and comprehensive mocked integration tests.

## Key Implementations

1. `POST /api/payments/create-intent` – validates class availability, duplicate booking, amount; creates Stripe PaymentIntent with rich metadata & idempotency key; persists pending Payment row.
2. `POST /api/bookings/confirm` – verifies PaymentIntent success + metadata integrity, idempotent pre-check, transactional capacity guard + booking creation, updates Payment to SUCCEEDED, marks FAILED on error paths, fires confirmation email stub.
3. Client booking form (`BookingForm.tsx`) – multi-step orchestration with friendly error mapping and disabled/retry states.
4. Email stub: `sendBookingConfirmationEmail` (future provider integration).
5. Stripe integration shims & polymorphic error codes surfaced to UI.

## Technical Decisions

| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Validation | Shared Zod schemas client/server | Single source of truth & consistent error formatting |
| Payment Metadata | Embed classId, userId, idempotency key | Supports reconciliation + duplicate prevention |
| Capacity Control | Re-count inside Prisma transaction | Prevents TOCTOU overbooking |
| Idempotency | Unique constraint + metadata key + pre-check | Multi-layer defense against double submits |
| Error Model | Machine codes mapped to friendly text | Clear UX & future i18n surface |
| Email | Fire-and-forget stub post transaction | Avoids user latency, pluggable provider |
| Testing | Focused integration with mocked Stripe | Verifies invariants & concurrency safety |

## Idempotency & Concurrency

Layered protections: (1) Duplicate booking pre-check, (2) Transactional capacity verification, (3) DB unique (userId,classId), (4) PaymentIntent metadata idempotency key. Parallel confirmation test demonstrates idempotent duplicate success returning identical booking state.

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | UI Handling |
|------|---------|-------------|
| capacity_full | Class reached capacity before confirmation | User shown capacity full message, retry disabled |
| payment_not_succeeded | Stripe intent not in succeeded state | Prompts retry after resolving payment issue |
| payment_metadata_mismatch | Metadata tampering / mismatch | Generic failure; logs detail server-side |
| class_not_found | Class deleted or invalid | Navigational error message |
| booking_confirm_failed | Unexpected confirm pathway error | Generic retry guidance |

## Tests

File: `tests/booking/booking-flow.test.ts`

| Scenario | Covered | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Happy path booking | Yes | Verifies Payment + Booking persistence |
| Duplicate booking | Yes | Second attempt returns existing booking invariant |
| Capacity full | Yes | Simulated capacity exhaustion prevents booking |
| Amount mismatch | Yes | Guards against client-side tampering |
| Payment not succeeded | Yes | Prevents premature booking creation |
| Parallel confirmations | Yes | Race safe & idempotent |

Mocks: Prisma, Stripe (create/retrieve intent), email sender, session.

## Documentation

`docs/api/booking-flow.md` details architecture, invariants, error codes, test matrix, and follow-ups.

## Artifacts

| Type | Path |
|------|------|
| API Route | `src/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts` |
| API Route | `src/app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts` |
| Client Form | `src/components/booking/BookingForm.tsx` |
| Client Container | `src/app/book/[id]/BookingClient.tsx` |
| Tests | `tests/booking/booking-flow.test.ts` |
| Docs | `docs/api/booking-flow.md` |

## Follow-up / Technical Debt

- Replace temporary `types/stripe-react.d.ts` once React 19 compatible types released.
- Consider server-side persisted idempotency key store for cross-network retries.
- Productionize email with Resend/SendGrid + DLQ for failures.
- Introduce structured logger & correlation IDs.
- Add monitoring dashboards (Stripe latency, booking throughput, failure rates).

## Verification

All mocked integration tests pass locally (Jest). Manual reasoning confirms invariants enforced. Task and subtasks 1–8 marked done in Taskmaster with appended info entries.

## Completion Statement

Task 8 and all subtasks are implemented, tested, and documented. Ready for dependent features (subscriptions, retreats, cancellations).
