  üéØ PRIORITY-RANKED IMPROVEMENTS

  üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY (Address Immediately)

  1. Authentication System Debug Cleanup

  Files: src/lib/auth/nextauth.ts:lines 28-77, 164-250
  - Issue: Production-level debug logging exposing
  sensitive authentication data
  - Impact: Security vulnerability, performance
  overhead
  - Fix: Remove all console.log statements, set debug:
   false, implement structured logging
  - Estimated Effort: 2 hours

  2. Dual Authentication System Consolidation

  Files: src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts,
  src/lib/auth/nextauth.ts
  - Issue: NextAuth and custom JWT running in parallel
  - Impact: Complexity, potential security gaps,
  maintenance overhead
  - Fix: Migrate entirely to NextAuth, remove custom
  JWT implementation
  - Estimated Effort: 1 day

  ‚ö° HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

  3. Video Library Security Review Completion

  Task: Complete Task 10, Subtask 10.1 (In Progress)
  - Issue: Security review incomplete for Mux signed
  token implementation
  - Impact: Blocks video library deployment
  - Fix: Complete security audit of RS256 token
  implementation
  - Estimated Effort: 4 hours

  4. Rate Limiting Implementation

  Files: src/app/api/payments/create-intent/route.ts,
  src/app/api/auth/**
  - Issue: Missing rate limiting on sensitive
  endpoints
  - Impact: Potential abuse vector for payment/auth
  endpoints
  - Fix: Implement per-user rate limiting with
  Redis/memory store
  - Estimated Effort: 6 hours

  üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY (Technical Debt)

  5. Modal Focus Management Enhancement

  File: src/components/ui/modal.tsx:lines 20-36
  - Issue: Missing focus trap implementation
  - Impact: Accessibility compliance gap
  - Fix: Implement proper focus management with
  focus-trap-react
  - Estimated Effort: 3 hours

  6. Bundle Size Optimization

  File: src/components/ui/modal.tsx:line 2
  - Issue: Framer Motion adds significant bundle
  weight
  - Impact: Slower initial page loads
  - Fix: Make Framer Motion conditional or replace
  with CSS animations
  - Estimated Effort: 4 hours

  üìä LOW PRIORITY (Optimization)

  7. Structured Logging Implementation

  Files: All API routes, webhook handlers
  - Issue: Inconsistent logging patterns across
  codebase
  - Impact: Difficult debugging in production
  - Fix: Implement Winston/Pino with correlation IDs
  - Estimated Effort: 1 day

  8. Authentication Caching Layer

  Files: src/lib/auth/nextauth.ts:lines 39-49
  - Issue: No caching for user lookups during
  authentication
  - Impact: Database load on auth-heavy endpoints
  - Fix: Implement Redis caching for user sessions
  - Estimated Effort: 6 hours
