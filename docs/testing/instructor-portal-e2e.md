# Instructor Portal End-to-End Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy for the Instructor Portal feature (Task 13.5), covering authentication, schedule display, student roster functionality, and access control validation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Authentication and Access Control Tests

#### 1.1 Instructor Authentication
- **Scenario**: Instructor logs in and accesses portal
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to E2E test bypass page
  2. Authenticate with test key
  3. Navigate to instructor portal (`/instructor`)
  4. Verify successful access and schedule display
- **Expected Result**: Portal loads with instructor's schedule visible

#### 1.2 Member Access Denial
- **Scenario**: Regular member cannot access instructor portal
- **Steps**:
  1. Attempt to access `/instructor` without instructor role
  2. Verify access is denied or redirected to login
- **Expected Result**: Access denied or login redirect

### 2. Schedule Display Functionality

#### 2.1 Schedule Data Loading
- **Scenario**: Instructor's schedule displays correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Authenticate as instructor
  2. Navigate to instructor portal
  3. Verify schedule sections are present (upcoming/past classes)
  4. Verify instructor information is displayed
- **Expected Result**: Schedule loads with proper sections and instructor context

#### 2.2 Class Information Display
- **Scenario**: Class cards show complete information
- **Steps**:
  1. Verify each class card displays:
     - Class title and description
     - Date and time information
     - Location
     - Capacity and enrollment count
     - Class status
- **Expected Result**: All class information is accurately displayed

#### 2.3 Upcoming vs Past Classes Segregation
- **Scenario**: Classes are properly categorized by date
- **Steps**:
  1. Verify upcoming classes appear in "Upcoming Classes" section
  2. Verify past classes appear in "Past Classes" section with dimmed styling
  3. Verify proper visual distinction between sections
- **Expected Result**: Temporal segregation is accurate and visually clear

### 3. Student Roster Modal Functionality

#### 3.1 Roster Modal Opening
- **Scenario**: "View Roster" button opens modal correctly
- **Steps**:
  1. Locate "View Roster" button on class card
  2. Click button
  3. Verify modal opens with class and student information
- **Expected Result**: Modal displays with correct class context

#### 3.2 Student List Display
- **Scenario**: Student roster shows accurate enrollment data
- **Steps**:
  1. Open roster modal for class with enrolled students
  2. Verify student count matches button display
  3. Verify each student entry shows:
     - Name and email
     - Booking date
     - Booking status (confirmed/cancelled)
     - Avatar initial
- **Expected Result**: Student information is complete and accurate

#### 3.3 Empty State Handling
- **Scenario**: Classes with no enrollments show appropriate message
- **Steps**:
  1. Open roster modal for class with zero enrollments
  2. Verify empty state message is displayed
  3. Verify helpful guidance text is shown
- **Expected Result**: Clear empty state with helpful messaging

#### 3.4 Modal Interaction and Accessibility
- **Scenario**: Modal supports proper interaction patterns
- **Steps**:
  1. Open modal using keyboard navigation (Enter key)
  2. Test tab navigation within modal
  3. Close modal using Escape key
  4. Verify focus management
- **Expected Result**: Full keyboard accessibility and proper focus handling

### 4. Data Accuracy Validation

#### 4.1 Schedule Data Integrity
- **Scenario**: Displayed schedule matches database state
- **Manual Verification**:
  1. Compare portal display with database queries
  2. Verify only instructor's assigned classes appear
  3. Confirm class details (time, location, capacity) are accurate
- **Expected Result**: 100% data accuracy between display and database

#### 4.2 Student Roster Data Integrity
- **Scenario**: Roster data matches actual bookings
- **Manual Verification**:
  1. Query database for class bookings
  2. Compare with modal display
  3. Verify booking statuses and dates
  4. Confirm student information accuracy
- **Expected Result**: Roster reflects actual database booking state

### 5. Multi-Instructor Isolation

#### 5.1 Instructor-Specific Data Display
- **Scenario**: Each instructor sees only their own classes
- **Steps**:
  1. Authenticate as Instructor A
  2. Record visible classes
  3. Logout and authenticate as Instructor B
  4. Verify different set of classes is displayed
- **Expected Result**: Complete data isolation between instructors

## Test Implementation

### Automated Tests
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Location**: `/tests/e2e/instructor-portal.test.ts`
- **Coverage**: 
  - Authentication flows
  - UI functionality
  - Modal interactions
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Basic data display verification

### Manual Test Cases
Due to the need for database state verification and multi-user testing, some scenarios require manual execution:

1. **Database Data Comparison**: Verify displayed data matches database state
2. **Multi-Instructor Testing**: Test with multiple real instructor accounts
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify portal loads efficiently with large datasets
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers and devices

## Test Data Requirements

### Database Setup
- At least 2 instructor accounts with different assigned classes
- Mix of upcoming and past classes for each instructor
- Classes with varying enrollment states (empty, partial, full)
- Students with different booking statuses (confirmed, cancelled)

### Test Environment
- E2E test bypass authentication enabled
- Database seeded with realistic test data
- All instructor portal dependencies available

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Instructors can successfully access their portal
- ✅ Schedule displays only instructor's assigned classes
- ✅ Student roster modal shows accurate enrollment data
- ✅ Empty states are handled gracefully
- ✅ Modal interactions work correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Portal loads within 3 seconds
- ✅ Accessible via keyboard navigation
- ✅ Responsive design works on mobile devices
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility maintained

### Security Requirements
- ✅ Non-instructors cannot access portal
- ✅ Instructors cannot see other instructors' classes
- ✅ Student data is displayed securely (no sensitive information)
