# Task 9.4 Completion - Stripe Webhook Subscription & Payment Handling

## Summary

Finalized Stripe webhook handler to fully support subscription lifecycle and recurring invoice payment events with idempotent processing and relational linkage between Payments and UserSubscription records.

## Key Enhancements

- Added synchronization of subscription + user membership status during `invoice.payment_succeeded` / `invoice.payment_failed` events.
- Linked Payment records to the associated `UserSubscription` (via `userSubscriptionId`) when available.
- Ensured `upsertUserSubscription` is invoked during invoice events to reflect status transitions (e.g., past_due → active, active → cancelled, etc.).
- Preserved idempotent event handling using `WebhookEvent` primary key guard plus application fallback.

## Data Consistency Guarantees

| Concern | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Event duplication | `WebhookEvent` table primary key (event.id) + `recordEventOnce` P2002 handling |
| Subscription plan resolution | Upsert plan on-demand using known price definitions |
| Membership status drift | Invoice events trigger `upsertUserSubscription` to reconcile state |
| Payment to subscription linkage | Lookup existing subscription by `stripeSubscriptionId` prior to payment upsert |

## Files Modified

- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`: Added subscription sync + payment linkage logic.

## Testing Recommendations (Next Steps)

1. Extend existing webhook idempotency test with scenarios:
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (first vs duplicate)
   - `customer.subscription.updated` causing status change
2. Add assertion that `payment.userSubscriptionId` is populated for invoice events.
3. Simulate failure path (e.g., missing plan) and verify graceful logging.

## Follow-On Work (Leads into Task 9.5)

- Implement session augmentation helper (`getActiveUserSubscription`) to expose membership in auth context.
- Add caching layer or short TTL revalidation for membership status in protected routes.
- Create tests for membership gating (e.g., accessing premium video while PAST_DUE should still allow until period end if strategy permits).

## Operational Logging

Structured `logEvent` continues to emit:

- phase: idempotency | handled | write
- eventType & subscriptionId for traceability

## Migration / Schema

No schema changes required; relies on existing `WebhookEvent`, `UserSubscription`, `Payment` models.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Race between invoice + subscription.updated events | Upsert logic idempotent; later event overwrites with latest Stripe state |
| Missing user metadata on subscription | Fallback customer metadata lookup retained |
| Legacy payments without subscription linkage | Historical Payment rows remain with null `userSubscriptionId`; acceptable |
