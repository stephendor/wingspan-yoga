   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/wingspan_yoga"
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Generate Prisma Client**
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

2. **Push Schema to Database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
   *Use for development. Creates tables without migration files.*

3. **Seed Database with Sample Data**
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Open Prisma Studio** (Optional)
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```
   *Visual database browser at http://localhost:5555*

### Production Setup

1. **Create Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
   *Creates migration files for version control*

2. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   npm run db:deploy
   ```
   *Applies migrations to production database*

## Sample Data

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens for session management
- Email verification for account activation
- Role-based access control through membership tiers
- Soft deletion patterns for data retention

## Performance Optimizations

- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Composite unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Efficient pagination support
- Connection pooling via Prisma
- Read replicas support (when configured)

## Future Enhancements

Potential schema extensions:

- Workshop and retreat management
- Loyalty points system
- Referral tracking
- Advanced analytics tables
- Multi-location support
- Equipment rental tracking
- Waitlist automation
- Advanced scheduling (recurring classes)
