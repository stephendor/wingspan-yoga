      "taskTitle": "Project Initialization and Scaffolding",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Project Initialization and Scaffolding' task into a series of sequential subtasks. Start with creating the version control repository on GitHub. Then, scaffold the Next.js application using `create-next-app`. Follow with individual subtasks for configuring Tailwind CSS, setting up ESLint and Prettier with a pre-commit hook, and finally, creating the initial directory structure for `/components`, `/lib`, `/app`, and `/styles`.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational but low in complexity as it follows well-documented, standard procedures. The tools (`create-next-app`, CLI initializers) automate most of the work. Breaking it down ensures each part of the development toolchain is configured correctly and sequentially before feature development begins."

      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Design and Migration Setup",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Database Schema Design' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up the PostgreSQL provider (Supabase/Neon) and connecting it via Prisma. 2. Defining core authentication and user models (User, Profile). 3. Defining primary business models (Class, Retreat, Video) and their properties. 4. Establishing relational/join models (Booking, Subscription) to connect users with business models. 5. Generating, reviewing, and applying the initial database migration using `prisma migrate dev`.",
      "reasoning": "Complexity is high due to the conceptual challenge of designing a scalable and robust database schema that supports all current and future application features. The number of interconnected models (User, Class, Booking, etc.) requires careful planning of relationships and constraints. Subdividing by model groups helps manage this complexity."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "UI Design System and Core Component Library",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'UI Design System' task into component-level subtasks. The first subtask should be to configure the `tailwind.config.js` file with the project's design tokens (colors, typography, spacing). Then, create a separate subtask for the implementation of each core component: Button, Input, Card, Modal, and Navigation Bar. Each component subtask should specify the need for accessibility (ARIA attributes, focus management) and subtle animations using Framer Motion.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity. While configuring Tailwind is simple, building a high-quality, accessible, and reusable component library is time-consuming. Each component (especially complex ones like Modal) is a mini-project with its own state, accessibility considerations, and variants. A component-by-component breakdown is the standard industry practice."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'CI/CD Pipeline' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Connecting the GitHub repository to the hosting provider (Vercel/Netlify) and configuring build settings. 2. Setting up distinct deployment environments for production, staging, and preview branches. 3. Securely adding all necessary environment variables (database URL, API keys) for each environment. 4. Configuring and verifying the automated weekly database backup process via the hosting provider's tools.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity. While modern platforms like Vercel greatly simplify deployment, managing multiple environments, handling secrets securely, and integrating external services like database backups requires careful, deliberate setup and verification. These steps are critical for operational stability and security."

      "taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Final QA",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Performance Optimization and Final QA' task. Create distinct subtasks for: 1. Analyzing the application bundle size with `@next/bundle-analyzer` and implementing code-splitting via dynamic imports for large components/pages. 2. Implementing a comprehensive image optimization strategy, including modern formats (WebP/AVIF) and lazy loading. 3. Auditing and optimizing key pages to achieve Lighthouse scores above 90. 4. Performing a full cross-browser and cross-device compatibility test on major platforms. 5. Conducting a final, full regression test of all user stories and critical paths.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity as this task combines two distinct and deep disciplines: performance engineering and quality assurance. Each sub-area, from bundle analysis to cross-browser testing, can uncover significant issues requiring substantial refactoring or fixes. It's a wide-ranging effort that touches the entire application."

      "taskTitle": "Accessibility Audit and Remediation (WCAG 2.1 AA)",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Accessibility Audit' task. Break it down into phases: 1. Conduct an automated accessibility scan of the entire application using tools like Axe and Lighthouse. 2. Perform a comprehensive manual audit focusing on keyboard-only navigation for all interactive elements. 3. Test all critical user flows (e.g., booking, login) using a screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA). 4. Audit all media content to ensure proper alt text for images and accurate captions/transcripts for videos. 5. Create a final subtask to remediate all issues identified in the audits to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the specialized knowledge required for WCAG standards and the meticulous nature of the work. Manual testing with assistive technologies is non-negotiable, time-consuming, and requires specific skills. Remediation can be complex, sometimes requiring significant component refactoring."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Security Best Practices",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Security Best Practices' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Configuring and testing security headers (especially a strict Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) in the Next.js configuration. 2. Implementing server-side rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints like login, registration, and password reset. 3. Auditing the Stripe integration to confirm that no sensitive cardholder data touches the server, ensuring PCI compliance via hosted Elements. 4. Running an external security scan (e.g., Mozilla Observatory) and remediating high-priority reported vulnerabilities.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity. While hosting and payment providers handle some aspects (SSL, PCI), correctly implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and effective rate limiting requires careful planning and testing to avoid breaking application functionality. These are critical for protecting the application and its users."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Third-Party Services Integration' task into one subtask for each service. 1. Implement a feature to generate and provide an `.ics` file for adding class bookings to external calendars like Google Calendar. 2. Integrate Zoom by storing and displaying unique meeting links for online classes, accessible only to booked users. 3. Create a serverless function to fetch and display the company's Instagram feed, avoiding client-side API exposure and performance bottlenecks.",
      "reasoning": "Low-to-moderate complexity. The described integrations are relatively shallow and self-contained. Generating a file or displaying a link is straightforward. The main challenge is interacting with the Instagram API, but using a serverless function isolates this complexity, and the overall impact on the core application architecture is minimal."
