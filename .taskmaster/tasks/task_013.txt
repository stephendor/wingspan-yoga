# Task ID: 13
# Title: Instructor Portal and Schedule View (ST-106)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a dedicated portal for instructors to view their personal teaching schedule and class rosters.
# Details:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between admin, instructor, and member roles. Create a protected route for instructors. On this page, query the database for classes assigned to the logged-in instructor's ID. Display the schedule and a list of booked students for each class.

# Test Strategy:
Log in as an instructor and verify access only to their own schedule. Log in as a different instructor and confirm they cannot see the first instructor's data. Check that the student list for a class is accurate.
