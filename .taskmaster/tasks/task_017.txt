# Task ID: 17
# Title: Third-Party Services Integration
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Embed and integrate other services like Google Calendar, Zoom, and Instagram.
# Details:
For Google Calendar, provide an 'Add to Calendar' link on booking confirmations using an iCal/.ics file generator. For Zoom, store meeting links in the `Class` model for online classes, accessible to booked users. For Instagram, use a lightweight third-party library or a serverless function to fetch and display the feed to avoid client-side performance hits.

# Test Strategy:
Book a class and click the 'Add to Calendar' link; verify it opens correctly in Google Calendar/iCal. Book an online class and check that the Zoom link is visible and correct. Verify the Instagram feed loads correctly on the homepage.
