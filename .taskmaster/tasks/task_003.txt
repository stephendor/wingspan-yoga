# Task ID: 3
# Title: UI Design System and Core Component Library
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the visual identity by creating a reusable component library and configuring the design tokens in Tailwind CSS.
# Details:
Configure `tailwind.config.js` with the brand's color palette (sage green, soft blues, terracotta), typography (Montserrat, Open Sans), and spacing scale. Create a library of core, accessible components: Button, Input, Card, Modal, and Navigation Bar using Framer Motion for subtle animations.

# Test Strategy:
Use Storybook or a dedicated style guide page to visually inspect all components in different states (hover, focus, disabled). Run accessibility checks (e.g., Axe) on each component to ensure proper ARIA attributes and color contrast.
