# Task ID: 12
# Title: Admin Dashboard for Class Management (ST-105)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure admin-only dashboard for performing CRUD operations on the class schedule.
# Details:
Create a protected route group for `/admin`. Build a UI with a table or calendar view of all classes. Implement forms (using React Hook Form) within modals or on separate pages for creating, updating, and deleting classes. Use Prisma mutations for database operations and revalidate data to update the UI.

# Test Strategy:
Log in as a non-admin user and verify access to `/admin` is denied. Log in as an admin and perform all CRUD operations. Verify that changes made in the admin dashboard are immediately reflected on the public-facing class schedule page.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Admin Route Protection Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure Next.js middleware to protect the `/admin` route group, ensuring only authenticated users with an 'ADMIN' role can access it.
### Details:
Create a `middleware.ts` file at the root of the `/app` directory. Inside the middleware, check the user's session (e.g., from NextAuth.js) for a role property. If the user is not authenticated or their role is not 'ADMIN', redirect them to the homepage ('/'). The middleware's matcher should be configured to run on all paths under `/admin/:path*`.

**Implementation Summary:**
The database schema was updated to support an admin role by adding `ADMIN` to the `MembershipType` enum and applying the migration `20250811061500_add_admin_membership_type`.

The middleware was implemented using `NextAuth.js`'s `getToken()` function for session validation. It is configured to protect all routes under `/admin/:path*`. The logic performs the following checks:
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/signin` with a `callbackUrl` parameter.
- Authenticated users without the 'ADMIN' membership type are redirected to the homepage ('/') with an error message.

This ensures that only authenticated admin users can access the admin dashboard routes.

## 2. Build Admin Dashboard Layout and Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop the main layout for the admin dashboard, including a persistent sidebar or header for navigation between different admin sections.
### Details:
Create a `layout.tsx` file within the `/app/admin` directory. This layout will wrap all admin pages. Implement a `AdminSidebar.tsx` component in `/components/admin/` that includes navigation links for 'Dashboard' (`/admin`) and 'Class Management' (`/admin/classes`). The main `/app/admin/page.tsx` will serve as the initial dashboard landing page.
<info added on 2025-08-11T06:34:00.667Z>
Implementation Summary:
- Created `/app/admin/layout.tsx` to wrap all admin pages with a sidebar and main content area.
- Created `/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` with navigation links to 'Dashboard' and 'Class Management'.
- Created `/app/admin/page.tsx` as the dashboard landing page.
- Fixed a minor lint error by removing an unused import. All files compile successfully.
</info added on 2025-08-11T06:34:00.667Z>

## 3. Develop Class List Table View with Data Fetching [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create a page to display all classes in a sortable and filterable table, fetching data directly from the database using Prisma.
### Details:
Create the page file at `/app/admin/classes/page.tsx`. This will be a server component that fetches all class records using `prisma.class.findMany()`. Pass the fetched data to a client component, `ClassTable.tsx` located in `/components/admin/`. This table should display key class details (e.g., Name, Instructor, Date, Time, Slots) and include controls for sorting columns.
<info added on 2025-08-11T06:36:04.338Z>
Implementation is complete. The server component at `/app/admin/classes/page.tsx` fetches all class records via Prisma, including related instructor data, and orders them by start time. This data is passed to the client component `/components/admin/ClassTable.tsx`, which renders the class details in a table with functional column sorting. The feature is now ready for testing with seeded class data.
</info added on 2025-08-11T06:36:04.338Z>

## 4. Implement 'Create Class' Form and Modal [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Build the UI and logic for creating a new class, using a modal containing a form managed by React Hook Form and validated with Zod.
### Details:
Add a 'Create New Class' button to the `/app/admin/classes/page.tsx`. This button will toggle a `CreateClassModal.tsx` component. The modal will contain a reusable `ClassForm.tsx` built with React Hook Form. Create a Zod schema for class validation. The form will submit to a `createClass` server action in `/lib/actions/class.actions.ts` which uses `prisma.class.create()`. On success, use `revalidatePath` to refresh the class table.
<info added on 2025-08-11T07:41:12.056Z>
Update the implementation to align with the new `ClassTemplate` and `ClassInstance` database schema for recurring classes. The `createClass` server action should now create a `ClassTemplate` record. The `ClassForm.tsx` and its Zod schema must be modified to capture recurrence details (e.g., day of week, start time, instructor) and the new `ClassCategory` enum values. The price input should be configured for GBP and store the value in pence.
</info added on 2025-08-11T07:41:12.056Z>

## 5. Implement 'Edit Class' Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Enable admins to edit existing classes by adding an 'Edit' button to the class table that opens a pre-populated form.
### Details:
In the `ClassTable.tsx` component, add an 'Edit' button to each row. Clicking it will open a modal that reuses the `ClassForm.tsx` component, pre-filled with the data for the selected class. The form will submit to a new `updateClass` server action that takes the class ID and updated data, using `prisma.class.update()`. Revalidate the path on successful update.

## 6. Implement 'Delete Class' with Confirmation Dialog [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Add functionality to delete a class from the table, including a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
### Details:
In `ClassTable.tsx`, add a 'Delete' button to each row. On click, display a confirmation modal (e.g., `AlertDialog` from Shadcn/UI) asking 'Are you sure?'. If confirmed, invoke a `deleteClass` server action in `/lib/actions/class.actions.ts`. This action will use `prisma.class.delete()` with the class ID. Revalidate the path to remove the class from the UI.
<info added on 2025-08-11T17:02:22.621Z>
**Implementation Notes:**
A 'Delete Template' button was added to the `AdminClassesClient` component. The confirmation dialog was implemented using an existing Modal UI component, which warns users that the deletion is permanent and will remove future class instances. A `handleDeleteTemplate` function was created to manage deletion state (`isDeleting`, `deletingTemplate`) and call the `deleteClassTemplate` server action from `/src/lib/actions/class.actions.ts`. The functionality includes success/error alerts and revalidates the `/admin/classes` path to update the UI upon successful deletion. The feature was tested successfully.
</info added on 2025-08-11T17:02:22.621Z>

## 7. Integrate Alternative Calendar View [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Provide an alternative calendar view for managing classes, with a toggle to switch between the table and calendar displays.
### Details:
On the `/app/admin/classes/page.tsx`, add a view-switcher (e.g., tabs). Create a `ClassCalendarView.tsx` component using a library like `react-big-calendar`. This component will receive the same class data as the table and render it on a weekly or monthly calendar. The view-switcher will conditionally render either `ClassTable.tsx` or `ClassCalendarView.tsx`.

## 8. End-to-End CRUD and Data Revalidation Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire admin CRUD workflow, ensuring data changes are correctly persisted and reflected on both the admin dashboard and public-facing pages.
### Details:
Execute the full test strategy for the parent task. Log in as an admin. Create a new class and verify it appears on the admin table, admin calendar, and the public class schedule page (from Task 7). Edit the class details and verify the change is reflected in all three locations. Finally, delete the class and verify it is removed from all views. Ensure all actions trigger UI updates via data revalidation.
