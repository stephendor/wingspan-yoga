# Task ID: 19
# Title: Accessibility Audit and Remediation (WCAG 2.1 AA)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform a full accessibility audit of the website and fix any issues to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
# Details:
Use tools like Axe, WAVE, and Lighthouse to scan all pages. Manually test with a screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA). Ensure all images have alt text, forms have labels, color contrast is >= 4.5:1, and keyboard navigation is logical. Add 'skip navigation' links. Provide captions/transcripts for all video content.

# Test Strategy:
Run automated scans and ensure zero critical errors. Navigate the entire site using only a keyboard. Use a screen reader to complete a key user flow (e.g., booking a class) and verify it is understandable and operable. Check video content for accurate captions.

## 2. Keyboard Navigation Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive keyboard navigation testing
### Details:

## 4. Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit and fix color contrast and visual accessibility issues
### Details:
