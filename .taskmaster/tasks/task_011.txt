# Task ID: 11
# Title: Video Progress Tracking
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to track and display a member's viewing progress for each video.
# Details:
Create a `VideoProgress` table in the database linked to `User` and `Video` models. On the client, use the video player's API to periodically send the current timestamp to a backend endpoint, which updates the database. Display a progress bar overlay on video thumbnails in the library.

# Test Strategy:
Watch a portion of a video, navigate away, and return to verify the video resumes from the correct timestamp. Check the library view to confirm the progress bar accurately reflects the watched percentage.
