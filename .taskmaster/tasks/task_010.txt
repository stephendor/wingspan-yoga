# Task ID: 10
# Title: Secure Video Library and Streaming (ST-104)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the members-only video library with secure video streaming from Mux or Vimeo.
# Details:
Set up video hosting on Mux or Vimeo. Create an API route that, for authenticated members, generates a signed URL or private playback token for a requested video. On the frontend, build a grid layout for the video library with search and category filters. Use a responsive video player (e.g., Plyr.io) to play the content from the secure URL.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that only authenticated, subscribed members can access the video library page. Attempt to access a video's direct URL without a valid token/signature to ensure it fails. Test video playback on various devices and network speeds to check adaptive streaming.
