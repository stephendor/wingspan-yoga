# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Security Best Practices
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhanced application security by successfully implementing comprehensive security headers, robust API rate limiting, and achieving full PCI compliance, resulting in an enterprise-grade security posture.
# Details:
All security best practices have been successfully implemented. This includes configuring comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) in `next.config.ts` with proper allowlisting for Stripe and Mux. Robust API rate limiting was implemented using `@upstash/ratelimit` for sensitive endpoints like registration (3 attempts/hour), payment (10 requests/min), authentication (5 attempts/min), and general APIs (100 requests/min), with a fallback in-memory solution for development. A detailed rate limiting library was created at `/src/lib/ratelimit.ts`. Full PCI DSS compliance was achieved and documented at `/docs/security/pci-compliance-audit.md`, confirming no raw card data storage, secure use of Stripe Elements, and proper webhook verification, making the application eligible for SAQ A. All high-priority vulnerabilities were remediated, and the application achieved an A- (85/100) overall security score in external scans, with documentation at `/docs/security/external-security-scan-report.md`. Comprehensive documentation was created for ongoing maintenance.

# Test Strategy:
Security headers were verified using external tools like Mozilla Observatory, confirming correct application and functionality without breakage. Rate limiting was validated with a dedicated test script (`scripts/test-rate-limiting.js`) that successfully blocked requests after defined thresholds for login, registration, and payment endpoints. PCI compliance was confirmed through a detailed audit, verifying the secure integration of Stripe's hosted elements and the absence of raw card data on the server.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Security Headers Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and test security headers in Next.js
### Details:
Implement Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers in next.config.js. Test headers are properly applied and don't break functionality

## 2. API Rate Limiting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints
### Details:
Add server-side rate limiting to authentication endpoints (login, registration, password reset) and payment endpoints to prevent brute force attacks and abuse

## 3. PCI Compliance Audit [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit Stripe integration for PCI compliance
### Details:
Ensure no sensitive cardholder data touches the server, verify proper use of Stripe Elements, implement webhooks securely, and confirm PCI compliance through hosted payment flows

## 4. External Security Scan [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run external security scan and remediate vulnerabilities
### Details:
Use Mozilla Observatory or similar tools to scan for security vulnerabilities, address any high-priority issues found, and ensure the application meets security best practices
