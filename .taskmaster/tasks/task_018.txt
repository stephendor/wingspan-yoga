# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Security Best Practices
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance application security by implementing rate limiting, security headers, and ensuring compliance.
# Details:
Configure SSL/TLS (handled by Netlify/Vercel). Add security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) via `next.config.js`. Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints (login, password reset) using a library like `upstash/ratelimit`. Ensure all payment processing is PCI compliant by using Stripe's hosted elements.

# Test Strategy:
Use a security scanner like Mozilla Observatory to check for proper header implementation. Write a script to hit the login endpoint repeatedly and verify that rate limiting blocks requests after a certain threshold. Review Stripe integration to confirm no raw card data touches the server.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Security Headers Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and test security headers in Next.js
### Details:
Implement Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and other security headers in next.config.js. Test headers are properly applied and don't break functionality

## 2. API Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints
### Details:
Add server-side rate limiting to authentication endpoints (login, registration, password reset) and payment endpoints to prevent brute force attacks and abuse

## 3. PCI Compliance Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit Stripe integration for PCI compliance
### Details:
Ensure no sensitive cardholder data touches the server, verify proper use of Stripe Elements, implement webhooks securely, and confirm PCI compliance through hosted payment flows

## 4. External Security Scan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run external security scan and remediate vulnerabilities
### Details:
Use Mozilla Observatory or similar tools to scan for security vulnerabilities, address any high-priority issues found, and ensure the application meets security best practices
