# Task ID: 7
# Title: Class Schedule Display and Filtering (ST-101)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the interactive class schedule page that fetches and displays class data with real-time filtering capabilities.
# Details:
Create a Next.js page with server-side rendering to fetch initial class data from the PostgreSQL database via Prisma. Implement client-side state management (Zustand/React Context) for interactive filters (by type, level, instructor). Ensure the calendar/list view loads in under 2 seconds.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the schedule displays correct class information. Test all filter combinations to ensure the list updates correctly and quickly. Use browser dev tools to confirm initial data is server-rendered and subsequent filtering is done on the client.
