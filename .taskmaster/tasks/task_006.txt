# Task ID: 6
# Title: Homepage and Static Pages Development
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the main public-facing pages of the website, including the Homepage and About page, using the established component library.
# Details:
Develop the Homepage with a hero section (video/image), featured offerings, testimonials, and a newsletter signup form stub. Create the 'About/Philosophy' and instructor bio pages. Ensure all pages are fully responsive and use Next.js Image for optimized images.

# Test Strategy:

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Homepage - Hero Section [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the main "above-the-fold" hero section. This includes integrating the background video or image and adding the primary headline and Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons using the established Button component.
### Details:
Focus on making this section visually impactful and ensuring the CTAs are prominent.

## 2. Develop Homepage - Featured Offerings Section [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the section that showcases key services (e.g., classes, retreats). This will likely involve using the Card component in a grid or carousel layout to display a summary of each offering with a link to learn more.
### Details:
This may require creating a small data structure or fetching placeholder data to populate the cards.

## 3. Develop Homepage - Testimonials Section [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated component to display client testimonials. This could be a simple grid or a more dynamic slider/carousel.
### Details:
Use the core typography and styling from the design system. Ensure it's easy to update with new testimonials later.

## 4. Build 'About/Philosophy' Page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the static /about page. Lay out the text and image content provided in the project requirements using the core component library for structure and styling.
### Details:
Focus on readability and brand alignment. Use Next/Image for all images.

## 5. Build Instructor Bio Page(s) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the page(s) for instructor biographies. This could be a single page with sections for each instructor or a template for individual bio pages.
### Details:
This is a good candidate for a reusable layout that can be populated with different instructor data.

## 6. Final Responsive Polish & QA [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Conduct a thorough review of all pages and sections created in the subtasks above. Adjust styling for tablet and mobile breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
