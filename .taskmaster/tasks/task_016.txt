# Task ID: 16
# Title: Email Marketing Integration (ST-108)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with Mailchimp or ConvertKit to sync contacts from website forms.
# Details:
Create an API route that takes an email from the newsletter signup form. Use the Mailchimp/ConvertKit Node.js SDK to add the email to a specific audience list. Add a checkbox to the registration form to allow users to opt-in to the newsletter upon signup.

# Test Strategy:
Submit an email via the newsletter form and verify the contact appears in the Mailchimp/ConvertKit list. Register a new user with the opt-in box checked and confirm they are also added to the list.
