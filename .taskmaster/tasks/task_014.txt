# Task ID: 14
# Title: Retreats Module with Partial Payments (ST-107)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the retreat showcase pages and a booking system that supports deposit payments.
# Details:
Develop dynamic pages for each retreat, pulling content from the database. For booking, use the Stripe Payment Intents API to create a charge for the deposit amount. Store the total price and amount paid in the booking record. Set up a scheduled job (cron/serverless scheduler) to trigger reminder emails for the remaining balance.

# Test Strategy:
Book a retreat and pay the deposit using a test card. Verify the booking is recorded with the correct partial payment status. Manually trigger the scheduled job to ensure a reminder email is sent. Test the flow for paying the remaining balance.
