Status mapping: active|trialing|past_due|canceled|incomplete.\n<info added on 2025-08-10T10:28:50.255Z>\n**Implementation Plan for 9.1 (Prisma schema & migration)**\n\n**Goal:** Introduce normalized subscription data model separating static plan definitions from user subscription lifecycle, enabling future multi-subscription history, plan upgrades, and clean event mapping.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Existing model `Subscription` (mapped to table `subscriptions`) contains both plan + status fields and is referenced by `User.subscriptionId` and `Payment.subscriptionId`.\n- User also stores `membershipType` + `membershipStatus` enums creating partial duplication with Subscription.plan/status.\n\n**Design Changes:**\n1.  Rename existing `Subscription` model to `UserSubscription` (retain `@@map(\"subscriptions\")` so DB table name unchanged; no data migration needed at SQL layer for rename in Prisma client).\n2.  Introduce new `SubscriptionPlan` model (table: `subscription_plans`) defining immutable plan metadata (price ref, billing interval, amount, currency, active flag, display name, description optional).\n3.  Replace fields in (now) `UserSubscription`:\n    -   Remove `plan` (MembershipType) & `stripePriceId`; instead reference `planId` (FK) to `SubscriptionPlan`.\n    -   Keep `stripeSubscriptionId`, `stripeCustomerId`, `status`, period start/end, `cancelAtPeriodEnd`.\n    -   Add `rawStripeData Json?` to capture latest full subscription object for audit/idempotency.\n4.  Adjust relations:\n    -   User: rename relation field from `subscription Subscription?` to `activeSubscription UserSubscription?` (field name `subscriptionId` can remain for pointer, or rename to `activeSubscriptionId` for clarity—will KEEP `subscriptionId` to avoid column rename in DB for now; relation type changes to UserSubscription).\n    -   Payment: rename foreign key `subscriptionId` to `userSubscriptionId` (since no existing code depends on subscriptions yet, safe; DB column rename required; will map old column name if wanting zero SQL rename—prefer clarity: introduce new field `userSubscriptionId` and deprecate old `subscriptionId`? Simpler: rename; migration will handle column rename). Given early stage, proceed with rename.\n5.  Enums remain unchanged initially (`MembershipType` still used at User level for role-based gating; can be deprecated later once derived from active plan).\n6.  Introduce new enum `BillingInterval` (MONTHLY, YEARLY) for `SubscriptionPlan.interval`.\n\n**Model Definitions (target):**\n```prisma\nmodel SubscriptionPlan {\n  id                String    @id @default(cuid())\n  stripePriceId     String    @unique\n  interval          BillingInterval\n  amount            Int\n  currency          String    @default(\"usd\")\n  name              String\n  description       String?\n  active            Boolean   @default(true)\n  createdAt         DateTime  @default(now())\n  updatedAt         DateTime  @updatedAt\n  userSubscriptions UserSubscription[]\n\n  @@map(\"subscription_plans\")\n}\n\nmodel UserSubscription {\n  id                   String      @id @default(cuid())\n  stripeSubscriptionId String      @unique\n  stripeCustomerId     String\n  planId               String\n  status               MembershipStatus\n  currentPeriodStart   DateTime\n  currentPeriodEnd     DateTime\n  cancelAtPeriodEnd    Boolean     @default(false)\n  rawStripeData        Json?\n  createdAt            DateTime    @default(now())\n  updatedAt            DateTime    @updatedAt\n\n  // Relations\n  plan                 SubscriptionPlan @relation(fields: [planId], references: [id])\n  user                 User?\n  payments             Payment[]\n\n  @@map(\"subscriptions\")\n}\n```\n\n**Ref Updates:** User: `subscriptionId` -> points to `UserSubscription`; rename relation alias. Payment: `subscriptionId` -> `userSubscriptionId`.\n\n**Migration Steps (conceptual):**\n1.  `prisma migrate dev --name subscription_model_refactor`\n2.  Confirm new tables & column renames:\n    -   New table `subscription_plans`\n    -   Alter `subscriptions`: drop column `stripePriceId`, `plan`; add `planId` (FK), `rawStripeData` Json\n    -   Alter `payments`: rename `subscriptionId` to `userSubscriptionId`.\n3.  Seed: Insert baseline plans (BASIC, PREMIUM, UNLIMITED) mapped to `stripePriceId` env values (done in later subtask 9.2, not here).\n\n**Risk & Mitigation:**\n-   Breaking change to existing code expecting `prisma.subscription`: will update references after schema change (currently no subscription feature code implemented).\n-   Column rename for `payments` may require manual SQL if migration fails—acceptable at this stage.\n\n**Next Actions:** 1) Mark in-progress 2) Apply schema.prisma patch 3) Update DATABASE.md (append new diagram snippet) 4) Leave migration to dev command.\n\n**Edge Consideration:** Keep `User.membershipType`/`membershipStatus` for now; will adjust logic in later subtasks to derive from active subscription.\n</info added on 2025-08-10T10:28:50.255Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-10T10:35:18.199Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-10T11:15:00.000Z>\n**Progress Update & Migration Blocker**\n\nThe planned schema refactor has been implemented in `schema.prisma` and related TypeScript type definitions.\n\n-   **Models:** The old `Subscription` model was replaced with `SubscriptionPlan` and `UserSubscription`. A new `BillingInterval` enum was also added.\n-   **Backward Compatibility:** To ensure a non-breaking database change, `UserSubscription` is mapped to the existing `subscriptions` table via `@@map`. Similarly, the `Payment.userSubscriptionId` field is mapped to the old `subscriptionId` column via `@map`, preserving the existing column name.\n-   **Validation:** `prisma validate` passes successfully.\n-   **Blocker:** The migration generation (`prisma migrate dev --name subscription_model_refactor`) is currently blocked by a P1001 error, as the local database instance was not running.\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n1.  Start the local database container/service.\n2.  Successfully generate the migration file by re-running `prisma migrate dev`.\n3.  Update the ERD in `DATABASE.md` to reflect the new schema.\n\nPlan seeding logic will be handled in subtask 9.2. A code audit for references to the old model structure will be performed after the migration is complete.\n</info>\n</info added on 2025-08-10T10:35:18.199Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-10T10:43:35.225Z>\nMigration generation remains blocked due to a local environment configuration issue. The root cause is a \"permission denied\" error from the Docker daemon, preventing the required Postgres container from starting. Attempts to bypass this by running the container directly or pointing `prisma migrate` to an alternative `DATABASE_URL` were unsuccessful (P1001). The immediate path forward is to resolve the Docker permissions (e.g., by adding the user to the `docker` group), connect to an externally hosted Postgres instance, or temporarily switch the datasource to SQLite to generate the necessary SQL. The schema itself is validated, but the migration file cannot be created until the database is accessible.\n</info added on 2025-08-10T10:43:35.225Z>",

The `planKey` must be an enum derived from the keys of `PLAN_DEFINITIONS`.\n2.  **Authentication:** Use `getServerSession(authOptions)` to get the user's session. A valid session with `user.id` and `user.email` is required.\n3.  **Plan Lookup:** Retrieve the plan details using `getPlanByKey(planKey)`. If the plan is not found, return a 400 error.\n4.  **(Optional) Price Existence Check:** Skip the heavy `assertStripePricesExist` check on every request, relying on the initial verification script. Add a `TODO` to implement caching for invalid states to avoid repeated checks.\n5.  **Stripe Customer:** Use a `getOrCreateCustomer` utility function with the user's email, name, and ID to find or create a Stripe Customer object.\n6.  **Create Checkout Session:** Call `stripe.checkout.sessions.create` with the following parameters:\n    - `mode: 'subscription'`\n    - `line_items: [{ price: plan.stripePriceId, quantity: 1 }]`\n    - `customer: customer.id`\n    - `success_url: successUrl || \\`${origin}/subscription/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}\\``\n    - `cancel_url: cancelUrl || \\`${origin}/membership/plans?cancelled=1\\``\n    - `metadata: { userId, planKey }`\n    - `subscription_data: { metadata: { userId, planKey } }`\n7.  **Response:** Return the checkout session URL and ID in the response body.\n8.  **Error Handling:** Implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors from the Stripe API. Log detailed errors internally and return a generic 500 error to the client.\n9.  **Idempotency:** Note in documentation that idempotency is not required for this endpoint, as creating multiple checkout sessions is acceptable.\n10. **Security:** Ensure the `planKey` is strictly mapped to predefined plan configurations to prevent injection or manipulation.\n\n**Future Dependencies:**\n- A `TODO` comment should be added to note that the database record for the `UserSubscription` will be created by the webhook handler (Subtask 9.4) upon successful payment, not by this endpoint. This is due to a pending database migration.\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- **Missing Environment Price:** If a Stripe price ID is missing from environment variables, the plan module should throw an error on import, causing the endpoint to return a 500 error.\n- **Existing Active Subscription:** For this version, allow users with an active subscription to create a new checkout session. Gating to prevent duplicate subscriptions will be handled in a future subtask (9.5).\n\n**Testing Hooks:**\n- **Unit Tests:** Mock the `stripe.checkout.sessions.create` call to verify that it is called with the correct parameters.\n- **Integration Tests:** Write a test for the happy path to ensure the endpoint returns a 200 status and a valid URL.\n</info added on 2025-08-10T10:58:56.343Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-10T11:01:24.786Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-10T16:30:15.123Z>\nCompletion Log:\n- Added API route at src/app/api/subscriptions/create/route.ts implementing POST subscription checkout session creation.\n- Validation: zod enum of PLAN_KEYS without any usage; success/cancel URL overrides.\n- Auth: Uses getServerSession; returns 401 otherwise.\n- Plan handling: rejects inactive/unknown plan; no DB interaction yet.\n- Stripe: Creates checkout session (mode=subscription) with metadata for userId & planKey at both session & subscription levels.\n- Lint: Resolved any usage; Codacy analysis clean (Semgrep, ESLint, Trivy no issues).\n- Logging: Console error on failure, generic client message.\n- TODO notes inserted for webhook creation & duplicate subscription gating.\nNext Focus: Subtask 9.4 (webhook handler) which will persist UserSubscription and update status transitions; will also need idempotency handling for events and signature verification.\n</info added on 2025-08-10T16:30:15.123Z>\n</info added on 2025-08-10T11:01:24.786Z>",

        "details": "1. **Centralize Prisma Mock:** Create a single, mock-extended Prisma client instance in a dedicated test setup file (e.g., `tests/singleton.ts`). Use `jest-mock-extended` to create a deep mock. Configure Jest (`setupFilesAfterEnv`) to use this setup file, ensuring all tests use the same mock instance without re-declaration. Refactor all existing auth tests to remove local mock setups.\n2. **Create API Request Helper:** The user request mentioned an `importPost` helper; this will be implemented as a generic API request helper. Create a function like `testApiHandler(handler, { method, body, query, headers })` that uses `node-mocks-http` to simulate API requests. This helper will encapsulate the creation of mock `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` objects, executing the handler, and returning the result for assertions. Replace manual mock object creation in tests with this helper.\n3. **Suppress Warnings & Reduce Console Noise:** For tests that are expected to trigger console output (e.g., testing a 401 error which logs an error message), use `jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {})` to temporarily silence the output for that specific test case. Use `afterEach(() => { jest.restoreAllMocks(); })` to ensure spies are reset between tests and do not affect other parts of the suite.",
        "testStrategy": "Run the entire test suite (`npm test`) and confirm all authentication-related tests still pass. Review the test runner's console output to verify that it is free of benign warnings and expected error logs. Manually inspect the pull request to confirm the shared `prismaMock` and the new API request helper are used correctly, reducing code duplication. Temporarily break an auth endpoint and verify that the corresponding test fails with a clear, actionable error message, ensuring the console suppression logic doesn't hide real failures.",

        "description": "Enhance the authentication system by introducing an 'INSTRUCTOR' role alongside the existing 'ADMIN' role, seed initial user accounts, and update application middleware to enforce role-based permissions for current and future features.",
        "details": "1. **Database Schema Enhancement:**\n   - Modify the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` to include a `role` field.\n   - Define a `Role` enum with values: `MEMBER`, `INSTRUCTOR`, `ADMIN`.\n   - Set the default value for the `role` field to `MEMBER`. Example: `role Role @default(MEMBER)`\n   - Generate and apply the new database migration using `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_user_roles`.\n\n2. **Update NextAuth.js Configuration:**\n   - In the NextAuth.js configuration file (e.g., `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`), update the session and JWT callbacks.\n   - Ensure the `role` from the user's database record is added to the JWT token during the `jwt` callback.\n   - Propagate the `role` from the token to the `session` object in the `session` callback so it's accessible in client and server components.\n\n3. **Seed User Accounts:**\n   - Create or update the `prisma/seed.ts` script.\n   - Use `bcrypt` to hash passwords before seeding.\n   - Create the ADMIN user: `email: 'admin@wingspan-yoga.com'`, `password: (hashed 'rufus@power0')`, `role: 'ADMIN'`.\n   - Create the INSTRUCTOR user: `email: 'anna@wingspan-yoga.com'`, `password: (hashed '100%Rufus')`, `role: 'INSTRUCTOR'`.\n   - Update `package.json` to ensure the seed script runs with `npx prisma db seed`.\n\n4. **Middleware for Route Protection:**\n   - In `middleware.ts`, enhance the logic to perform role-based authorization.\n   - Read the user's role from the `next-auth.token` object.\n   - Protect route groups based on roles: \n     - `/admin/**`: Requires `ADMIN` role.\n     - `/instructor/**`: Requires `INSTRUCTOR` or `ADMIN` role.\n   - Redirect unauthorized users to a login page or a '403 Forbidden' page.\n\n5. **Define Permission Matrix:**\n   - Create a file like `lib/permissions.ts` to document and potentially export the permission structure for easy reference and use in the application.\n   - **ADMIN:** Full CRUD on all data models (Classes, Users, Posts, Videos), access to security settings, full system access.\n   - **INSTRUCTOR:** Read access to assigned classes and rosters. Create/Update/Delete permissions for future content they own (Blog Posts, Videos). No access to other user data or system settings.\n   - **MEMBER:** Read access to public content, booking management for their own account.\n<info added on 2025-08-12T16:16:49.164Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-12T16:15:00Z>\n**Implementation Summary**\n\n1.  **Database Schema Enhancement:** Added a `Role` enum (`MEMBER`, `INSTRUCTOR`, `ADMIN`) and a `role` field to the `User` model, with `MEMBER` as the default. A new migration (`20250812160722_add_user_roles`) was successfully applied.\n2.  **User Account Seeding:** Created an ADMIN user (`admin@wingspan-yoga.com`) and an INSTRUCTOR user (`anna@wingspan-yoga.com`). Both were verified in the database with correct roles and hashed passwords.\n3.  **NextAuth.js Configuration:** The JWT and session callbacks were updated to propagate the user's `role` into the token and session object, making it available throughout the application. OAuth user creation was also updated to assign the default `MEMBER` role.\n4.  **Middleware for Route Protection:** The application middleware was enhanced to protect routes based on roles. `/admin/**` requires the `ADMIN` role, and `/instructor/**` requires either `INSTRUCTOR` or `ADMIN`. Unauthorized users are redirected.\n5.  **Permission Matrix:** A new file, `lib/permissions.ts`, was created to document the permission structure for each role and includes helper functions for permission checking.\n\n**Testing Results**\n- All migration and seeding scripts completed successfully.\n- Role-based access control was verified for both `/admin` and `/instructor` routes. Unauthenticated and unauthorized users are correctly redirected to the sign-in page.\n- The RBAC foundation is now established, satisfying the dependencies for Task 13 (Instructor Portal).\n</info>\n</info added on 2025-08-12T16:16:49.164Z>",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Migration and Seed Verification:**\n   - Run `prisma migrate dev` and confirm the script executes successfully.\n   - Inspect the `User` table in the database to verify the `role` column exists and is an enum type.\n   - Run `prisma db seed` and query the database to confirm the 'admin@wingspan-yoga.com' and 'anna@wingspan-yoga.com' users exist with their correct roles and hashed passwords.\n\n2. **Role-Based Access Control Tests:**\n   - **Admin User:** Log in as `admin@wingspan-yoga.com`. Navigate to the `/admin` dashboard (from Task 12) and verify access is granted. Attempt to access instructor-only pages (from Task 13, once built) and verify access is granted.\n   - **Instructor User:** Log in as `anna@wingspan-yoga.com`. Attempt to navigate to the `/admin` dashboard and verify you are redirected or shown a 'Forbidden' error. Verify you can access the future `/instructor` portal.\n   - **Standard User:** Register a new user (who will have the default `MEMBER` role). Log in and verify access to both `/admin` and `/instructor` routes is denied.\n   - **Unauthenticated User:** Attempt to access any protected route (`/admin`, `/instructor`) and verify redirection to the login page.\n\n3. **API Endpoint Protection:**\n   - Using an API client like Postman, obtain a JWT for the instructor user.\n   - Attempt to call an admin-only API endpoint (e.g., `DELETE /api/users/:id`) with the instructor's JWT. Verify the server responds with a `403 Forbidden` status code.\n   - Attempt to call an API endpoint the instructor should have access to (e.g., `GET /api/classes/my-schedule`) and verify a `200 OK` response.",
