# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** What is the best way to subdivide these into subtasks with detail?,

**Response:**

Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of how to subdivide the remaining project tasks into actionable subtasks, based on the provided context.

The best way to subdivide these tasks is to break them down by functional area (e.g., Backend API, Frontend UI, Testing) and create a logical sequence of dependencies. This makes the work easier to assign, track, and test.

Here is a breakdown for the tasks marked `todo`, `in-progress`, and `review`.

### **Task 16: Email Marketing Integration (ST-108)**

**Status:** `todo`
This task involves both backend API work and frontend UI changes in two different places. It's best to build the backend functionality first, then wire up the different frontend components to it.

**Proposed Subtasks:**

1.  **Subtask 16.1: Setup & Configuration**
    *   **Description:** Choose the provider (Mailchimp or ConvertKit), obtain the API key and audience/list ID. Install the required Node.js SDK (`npm install @mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing` or the ConvertKit equivalent). Securely store the API key and list ID as environment variables (`.env.local`).
    *   **Detail:** This is a foundational step. No code can be written until the credentials and SDK are in place.

2.  **Subtask 16.2: Develop Backend API Endpoint**
    *   **Description:** Create a new API route, for example, `POST /api/newsletter/subscribe`. This route should accept an email address in the request body, perform basic validation (e.g., is it a valid email format?), and use the provider's SDK to add the contact to the designated list.
    *   **Detail:** Implement robust error handling for cases like an invalid API key, a user already being subscribed, or the provider's API being down. Return clear success or error messages.

3.  **Subtask 16.3: Integrate Homepage Newsletter Form**
    *   **Description:** Connect the newsletter signup form (mentioned in Task 6) to the new API endpoint.
    *   **Detail:** Implement client-side logic to handle the form submission, call the `/api/newsletter/subscribe` route, and display loading, success, or error states to the user. This depends on Subtask 16.2.

4.  **Subtask 16.4: Update Registration Form UI**
    *   **Description:** Modify the user registration component to include a new checkbox with a label like "I'd like to receive news and updates via email."
    *   **Detail:** Ensure the checkbox is accessible and its state is managed correctly within the registration form's data.

5.  **Subtask 16.5: Update User Registration Logic**
    *   **Description:** Modify the backend logic that handles new user registration (likely part of the NextAuth implementation from Task 4). If the newsletter opt-in checkbox is checked, call the same subscription service created in Subtask 16.2 to add the new user's email to the list.
    *   **Detail:** This reuses the core subscription logic, ensuring consistency. It should be done carefully to not interfere with the core registration flow if the email subscription fails.

6.  **Subtask 16.6: End-to-End Testing**
    *   **Description:** Execute the test strategy. Manually test the homepage form and the registration opt-in. Verify in the Mailchimp/ConvertKit dashboard that contacts are added correctly and, if applicable, with the correct source tag (e.g., 'newsletter-form' vs. 'registration-signup').

### **Task 6: Homepage and Static Pages Development**

**Status:** `in-progress`
This is a broad frontend task. Breaking it down by page and then by major component section is the most effective approach.

**Proposed Subtasks:**

1.  **Subtask 6.1: Develop Homepage - Hero Section**
    *   **Description:** Implement the main "above-the-fold" hero section. This includes integrating the background video or image and adding the primary headline and Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons using the established `Button` component.
    *   **Detail:** Focus on making this section visually impactful and ensuring the CTAs are prominent.

2.  **Subtask 6.2: Develop Homepage - Featured Offerings Section**
    *   **Description:** Build the section that showcases key services (e.g., classes, retreats). This will likely involve using the `Card` component in a grid or carousel layout to display a summary of each offering with a link to learn more.
    *   **Detail:** This may require creating a small data structure or fetching placeholder data to populate the cards.

3.  **Subtask 6.3: Develop Homepage - Testimonials Section**
    *   **Description:** Create a dedicated component to display client testimonials. This could be a simple grid or a more dynamic slider/carousel.
    *   **Detail:** Use the core typography and styling from the design system. Ensure it's easy to update with new testimonials later.

4.  **Subtask 6.4: Build 'About/Philosophy' Page**
    *   **Description:** Create the static ` /about` page. Lay out the text and image content provided in the project requirements using the core component library for structure and styling.
    *   **Detail:** Focus on readability and brand alignment. Use `Next/Image` for all images.

5.  **Subtask 6.5: Build Instructor Bio Page(s)**
    *   **Description:** Develop the page(s) for instructor biographies. This could be a single page with sections for each instructor or a template for individual bio pages.
    *   **Detail:** This is a good candidate for a reusable layout that can be populated with different instructor data.

6.  **Subtask 6.6: Final Responsive Polish & QA**
    *   **Description:** Conduct a thorough review of all pages and sections created in the subtasks above. Adjust styling for tablet and mobile breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
    *   **Detail:** Test all links, buttons, and forms. Run a Lighthouse audit to check for initial performance, accessibility, and SEO metrics and address any major issues.

### **Task 10: Secure Video Library and Streaming (ST-104)**

**Status:** `review`
Since this task is in review, the subtasks should be structured around the review and validation process itself. This ensures all aspects of the implementation are checked before it's marked as `done`.

**Proposed Subtasks:**

1.  **Subtask 10.1: Code & Security Review**
    *   **Description:** A senior developer or peer should review the implementation. This includes the API route that generates the Mux signed tokens and the frontend code that requests and uses them.
    *   **Detail:** Check for security best practices (e.g., are secrets handled correctly?), code clarity, and efficiency. Ensure the RS256 token implementation is correct.

2.  **Subtask 10.2: Functional & Authorization Testing**
    *   **Description:** Systematically execute the test strategy. A tester or developer should attempt to access the video library and video assets under different conditions.
    *   **Detail:**
        *   Verify a subscribed member can view videos.
        *   Verify a non-subscribed member is blocked.
        *   Verify a logged-out user is redirected to login.
        *   Verify that trying to access a Mux stream URL directly (without a valid token) results in a failure/403 error.

3.  **Subtask 10.3: UI/UX and Player Experience Review**
    *   **Description:** Review the frontend experience. Check the video grid layout, search, and category filters for usability. Test the Plyr.io player controls.
    *   **Detail:** Does the player have a good loading state? Is the search/filter functionality intuitive and fast? Is the overall layout aesthetically pleasing and on-brand?

4.  **Subtask 10.4: Cross-Device & Performance Testing**
    *   **Description:** Test the video library on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
    *   **Detail:** Confirm the layout is responsive and the video player works correctly everywhere. Check how Mux's adaptive streaming performs on a simulated slow network connection.

5.  **Subtask 10.5: Implement Review Feedback**
    *   **Description:** Create and address any tickets or action items that arise from the reviews in subtasks 10.1-10.4.
    *   **Detail:** This is the "fix-it" phase, where any bugs, UI inconsistencies, or security concerns are resolved before the task is officially completed.
